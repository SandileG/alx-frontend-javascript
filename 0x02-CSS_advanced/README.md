# CSS Concepts and Resources

## Resources

### 1. CSS Reference
- **A free visual guide to CSS**: This resource provides comprehensive information about CSS properties, selectors, and values. It serves as a great starting point for both beginners and experienced developers looking to refresh their knowledge.

### 2. Can I Use
- **Support tables for HTML5, CSS3, etc.**: This tool allows developers to check the browser compatibility of various HTML and CSS features. It helps ensure that the styles you implement will work across different platforms and versions.

### 3. CSS Properties | HTML Dog
- A straightforward guide to CSS properties, including their descriptions and usage. This resource is beneficial for understanding how each property works and how it can be applied in different scenarios.

### 4. Box Sizing
- Understanding the box model is crucial for layout design. The box-sizing property can change how width and height are calculated, which can simplify CSS layouts by including padding and borders in the element’s total width and height.

### 5. CSS Specificity Calculator
- This tool helps developers understand how specificity works in CSS. It’s essential for resolving conflicts between styles, as different selectors have different levels of specificity.

### 6. Play with CSS Selector
- An interactive tool to experiment with CSS selectors and see how they apply to HTML elements. It’s useful for learning and testing selector behavior.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts clearly:

### Selectors, Properties, and Values
- **Selectors** are patterns used to select the elements you want to style.
- **Properties** are the aspects of the selected elements that you can modify (e.g., color, font-size).
- **Values** are the specific settings you apply to properties (e.g., `color: blue;`).

### The Difference Between Block and Inline Styling
- **Block elements** (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`) take up the full width available and start on a new line.
- **Inline elements** (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`) do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

### Ensuring Consistency Across All Browsers (CSS Reset)
- A CSS reset is a set of styles that remove default browser styles to create a consistent baseline across all browsers. Common resets include `normalize.css` and Eric Meyer’s CSS reset.

### Setting Up CSS Variables
- CSS variables (custom properties) allow you to store values that can be reused throughout your stylesheet. They are defined using the `--variable-name` syntax and can help maintain consistency and ease of updates.

### Differences Between Inline, Embedded, and External CSS
- **Inline CSS** is applied directly within an HTML element using the `style` attribute.
- **Embedded CSS** is included in the `<style>` section of the HTML document.
- **External CSS** is contained in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML document, promoting cleaner code and separation of concerns.

### How Grid Systems Work (with Floats)
- Grid systems help create responsive layouts. Historically, floats were used for layout, but modern CSS Grid and Flexbox offer more powerful and intuitive options for structuring web pages.

### Differences Between Icons, Webfonts, and SVG Icons
- **Icons** can be bitmap images (PNG, JPG) or vector graphics (SVG).
- **Webfonts** are fonts loaded from the web (e.g., Google Fonts) that enhance typography.
- **SVG icons** are vector-based graphics that can scale without losing quality and are often used for icons.

### Differences Between Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements
- **Pseudo-classes** (e.g., `:hover`, `:active`) style elements based on their state.
- **Pseudo-elements** (e.g., `::before`, `::after`) style specific parts of elements, like the first letter or line.

### Making Background Gradients
- CSS gradients can create smooth transitions between colors. They can be linear or radial and are defined using the `background-image` property.

### Animating Elements in CSS
- CSS animations allow you to change the appearance of elements over time, using properties like `@keyframes` and animation properties (e.g., `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`).

### Transforming Elements (2D, 3D)
- CSS transforms enable you to rotate, scale, translate, or skew elements. 2D transforms affect the plane of the screen, while 3D transforms involve depth and perspective.

### Vendor Prefixes
- Vendor prefixes (e.g., `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, `-ms-`) are used to enable experimental features in different browsers before they are standardized. They allow developers to access features that may not yet be fully supported across all browsers.
