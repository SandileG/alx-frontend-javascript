# Data Manipulation in ES6

This document provides a concise overview of various data structures and manipulation methods introduced in ES6, including arrays, typed arrays, sets, maps, and weak maps. Understanding these concepts is crucial for modern JavaScript development.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Arrays
- **Definition**: Arrays are ordered collections of values that can be of any type (numbers, strings, objects, etc.).
- **Key Methods**:
  - **map()**: Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array.
  - **filter()**: Creates a new array containing only elements that pass a certain condition defined by a function.
  - **reduce()**: Reduces the array to a single value by applying a function to each element and accumulating the result.

### 2. Typed Arrays
- **Definition**: Typed arrays provide a mechanism for accessing raw binary data in memory.
- **Characteristics**:
  - They have a fixed length.
  - Types include `Int8Array`, `Uint8Array`, `Float32Array`, etc.
- **Use Cases**: Often used in performance-sensitive applications, such as web graphics and games.

### 3. Set Data Structure
- **Definition**: A `Set` is a collection of unique values, meaning no duplicates are allowed.
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatically removes duplicates when elements are added.
  - Supports operations like `add()`, `delete()`, and `has()`.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for scenarios where unique items are required, such as maintaining a list of distinct user IDs.

### 4. Map Data Structure
- **Definition**: A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any type.
- **Key Features**:
  - Maintains the insertion order of elements.
  - Supports methods like `set()`, `get()`, `delete()`, and `has()`.
- **Use Cases**: Useful for situations where data needs to be associated with unique keys, such as a dictionary or database record.

### 5. WeakMap
- **Definition**: A `WeakMap` is similar to a `Map`, but its keys must be objects, and these keys are weakly held.
- **Characteristics**:
  - If there are no other references to the key, the object can be garbage-collected, preventing memory leaks.
  - Does not have methods like `keys()`, `values()`, or `entries()`, making it less iterable than `Map`.
- **Use Cases**: Commonly used for private data or when working with DOM elements where you want to associate metadata without preventing garbage collection.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- How to effectively use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays to manipulate and transform data.
- The purpose and functionality of typed arrays in handling binary data.
- The characteristics and applications of the `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap` data structures in JavaScript.
