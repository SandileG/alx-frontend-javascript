# TypeScript

### 1. **Basic Types in TypeScript**
TypeScript offers a variety of types to help ensure that your code is more predictable and reliable. These types include:
- **Primitives**: These are basic types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and `null`, which ensure that variables hold the expected values.
- **Arrays**: Arrays in TypeScript can be typed, such as `string[]` or `Array<number>`, ensuring that the contents of the array are consistent.
- **Tuples**: Tuples allow you to define an array with a fixed number of elements where each element can have a different type, e.g., `[string, number]`.
- **Enums**: Enumerations provide a way to define a set of named constants, improving code readability and preventing invalid values from being used.

### 2. **Interfaces, Classes, and Functions**
- **Interfaces**: Interfaces define the shape of an object, specifying the structure that an object must adhere to. They are used to describe what properties an object should have.
  ```ts
  interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  }
  ```
- **Classes**: TypeScript classes allow you to create objects with properties and methods, supporting features like inheritance, abstract classes, and access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`).
  ```ts
  class Student implements Person {
    constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}
  }
  ```
- **Functions**: Functions in TypeScript can be strongly typed, ensuring that the input parameters and return types are consistent. Arrow functions are also common in TypeScript for concise syntax.

### 3. **How to Work with the DOM and TypeScript**
TypeScript provides strong typing support when working with the Document Object Model (DOM). By using TypeScript’s types, you can interact with HTML elements in a more structured and error-free way. For instance, when you select an HTML element, TypeScript can infer the type, and you can explicitly cast it if needed.
  ```ts
  const button = document.getElementById("myButton") as HTMLButtonElement;
  button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Button clicked");
  });
  ```

### 4. **Generic Types**
Generics provide a way to create reusable code components by using type variables. This allows you to define a function, class, or interface with a placeholder type that can be determined when it is used. Generics help write more flexible and reusable code.
  ```ts
  function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
  }
  ```
In this case, `T` is a type variable that can be substituted with any type when the function is called.

### 5. **Namespaces**
Namespaces in TypeScript provide a way to organize and manage your code, especially in large applications. They allow you to group related code together, helping to avoid name collisions.
  ```ts
  namespace Utils {
    export function log(message: string) {
      console.log(message);
    }
  }

  Utils.log("Hello, TypeScript");
  ```

### 6. **How to Merge Declarations**
Declaration merging is a feature in TypeScript that allows you to combine multiple declarations into a single definition. This is particularly useful when working with external libraries or adding properties to existing objects or interfaces.
  ```ts
  interface User {
    name: string;
  }

  interface User {
    age: number;
  }

  const user: User = { name: "John", age: 30 };
  ```
Here, both declarations of the `User` interface are merged into one.

### 7. **How to Use an Ambient Namespace to Import an External Library**
Ambient namespaces allow you to declare types and modules for libraries that are not written in TypeScript. This allows you to safely import and use external JavaScript libraries in TypeScript projects by defining type declarations for those libraries.
  ```ts
  declare namespace jQuery {
    function ajax(url: string, settings?: any): void;
  }

  jQuery.ajax("/api/data");
  ```
In this example, we declare the `jQuery` namespace to allow the use of `jQuery.ajax` in TypeScript without having the actual implementation in TypeScript.

### 8. **Basic Nominal Typing with TypeScript**
Nominal typing refers to a type system where types are distinguished by their names rather than their structure (which is more common in TypeScript’s structural typing). While TypeScript is structurally typed by default, nominal typing can be mimicked using techniques such as branding.
  ```ts
  type UserID = string & { readonly brand: unique symbol };
  function createUserId(id: string): UserID {
    return id as UserID;
  }
  ```
In this example, the `UserID` type is created by branding the `string` type to prevent accidental misuse in places where a normal string might not be appropriate.
